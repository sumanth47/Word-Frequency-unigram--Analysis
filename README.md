# Word-Frequency-unigram--Analysis

Context:
How frequently a word occurs in a language is an important piece of information for natural language processing and linguists. In natural language processing, very frequent words tend to be less informative than less frequent one and are often removed during preprocessing. Human language users are also sensitive to word frequency. How often a word is used affects language processing in humans. For example, very frequent words are read and understood more quickly and can be understood more easily in background noise.
